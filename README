This is an attempt for me to learn about jQuery and improve on my lacking javascript abilities.

I am using http://blueprintcss.org css grids and what not to get a quick sample index.html.

I am basing this off of Tim Morgan's tabs.js http://github.com/seven1m/onebody/blob/6193cdf62657af8bf48390f608df5455eb0ef643/public/javascripts/tabs.js, which
means this if pretty much a duplication of his code with some minor tweaks to suite me better. :)
